After experiencing different types of work.

I have yet to finalize what my dream job will be.

As I get older and my curcumstance changes, so does my goal.

I left my electrician job to become a software engeneer in my early 30s

This was the best decision I have made in my career.

I am still learning more and more which plays a part of what I do like.

I also have to think about my wife and kids.

I won't be able to just relocate so I prefer to work remotely.

Everything is becoming more expensive so I have to continuesly increase my income.

Although I am interested in game development, it's a big investement of time.

I can easily pick it up with my current skills but I am still undecided.

This is probably why I haven't decided on a dream job yet.

I know that I do want to write code and work with software.

I also want to work remotely and have a 6 figure job.

Eventually I would like to get into freelancing where I can set my own hours.

I also can work on different project and even get paid more.

I started learning about cloud engineering and devops but I'm not sure.

It is taking some time to learn a lot of the basic of so many technologies.

I am currently struggling to keep up with the expenses.
