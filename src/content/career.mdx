## My journey (about me)

Growing up I was always passionate about computers.

I was very techy from a young age during my time, not compare to today's time where 3 years old can do better.

I always wanted to build a computer and just work with one.

That course changed when I was applying to high school.

Electrical Enginnering was not what I thought it was.

Although you will learn a little bit about that for computer it was more focus for electricians.

I was a quiet and shy kid, so I never spoke up and it changed my course.

I wish I was more outspoken and with more courage to speak up.

## Background

I studied Electrical Engineering since high school.

I became very good at it and decided to pursue it as a career.

After working in the electrical field for 7 years. I decided to change career.

Programming was something I wanted to do for a while but was always hesitent to jump to.

I doubted myself because I thought I needed a degree to get into this field.

I was working full time and didn't know where to start or how to program.

After some time I've learned that you don't need a degree to get into this field.

As long as you know how to do the work, some company will hire you.

I've seen story of people getting a job without a degree.

It gave me some hope and the more I looked into this the more hope I got.

I decided to but two textbook, one for HTML and CSS, and the other book for JavaScript.

A lot of people recommended this as it was an easy path for beginners.

Other people would say Python but I say it depends what do you want to do.

HTML and CSS will always be on my list as you can learn it in less than a month.

Depending what do you want to do will depend on which language will you need to learn.

Most of the common language have the same syntax from declaring to invoking.

You can solve the same problems with different language but the efficiency and difficulty difer.

I was really happy and excited writting my first line of code and running it on my browser.

## Passion

I enjoy creating, solving problems, learning, teaching, collaborating which I get in this field.

Working with computer is something I always wanted to do since I was younger.

Although it was not exactly what I was thinking I know I made the best choice.

## What companies look for

More and more companies in the development world are not hiring based on your education.

You should go to college for a computer science degree or a Coding Bootcamp if you can.

It will greatly help you and give you a head start compare to someone who is self taught.

Most tech companies only want to know if you have the skill needed to complete the work.

This will save the company money and time from training someone.

If you are interested in working for a certain company, you should try to learn the skills the position requires.

This can save you a lot of time but you also want to make sure you want and enjoy that position.

Some company also prioritize soft skills like leadership, communication, teamwork, ect.

You can even apply to other companies to start getting some interview experience.

There's also a few website like Pramp.com and Interviewing.io where you can practice.

Almost all your interviews will have some Data Structure and Algorithm questions.
