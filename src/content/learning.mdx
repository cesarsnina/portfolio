## Learning

Learning can be difficult at first when you don't know what to study.

I wanted to become a software engineer but I didn't know where to start.

I even read a bit of it's history knowing I will never use it.

As time goes by and I start understanding the essentials.

I started learning the basic of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The more you study the easier it is to learn because everything is connected.

What do I mean by that? A lot of the technologies have the same concept.

When they say that you can pick up another language if you learn one is true.

Declaring functions with parameter, variables, for-loop and more are the same.

Libraries and Frameworks are easier to learn when you already know the language.

If you go to events or join some hackerank that you can compete or colaborate can help.

We tend to push ourself much more when we are working with others.

Another is taking a class where you get instructions to help you.

## Free Resource

There's a lot of free resources out there but it can be time comsuming.

You will have to find the resources, maybe it's something that you will never use.

Sometimes you bump into the same materials or doesn't provide enough details.

It can make you feel lost and lose your motivation or feel overwhelmed with information.

First you need to know what do you want to do. Game Developer, Web Developer, Cloud Engineering, ect.

It helps to look into the most popular technology that the position mostly use.

This way you can narrow down the amount of resources to look into.

I would take a week to look into many roles and what are their responsibility.

Then start learning by looking into the technology, reading, looking at video to get expose.

Try to get an evnironments set up and follow some tutorial to get experience.

This will help you identify if this is what you want while understanding how it works.

Some tips to help you avoid paying is to become self-taught.

With so many free resources out there it's easy to do it yourself.

## Paid Resources

I am someone that tries to avoid paying when I can.

It is worth investing but no matter how good things may sound, not all are worth it.

I would recommend looking into the resource, curriculum, and reviews.

The last thing you want to say is it's a waste of time, money or it's a scam.

Paying will actually speed up the process and there's a lot of good resources.

I would recommend this if you have the budget and for some cases time.

A lot of the courses or Bootcamp require you to participate full-time.

It would be wise to find some free resources and go through them before paying.

You will get a better understanding and determine if that's what you want to do.

Assuming you picked up the basic during the free course you can pay for a course.

Once you pay for a course, you can focus on the more advance skills.

## Software engineering may not be for you

If you don't like or enjoy learning.

If you don't like to read.

If you don't want to be self-taught.
