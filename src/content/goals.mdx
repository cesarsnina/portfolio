Your goals should be the result of what you want.

Whether it's to lose 20 pounds or create a project.

A good approach would be to break down the goals into small tasks.

Especially when working with larger project.

If you working in teams then you can split the tasks.

The task should be steps to get you closer to your goal.

If you want to create an ecommerce website a task can be creating the home page.

You can further break it down by splitting that task into features.
